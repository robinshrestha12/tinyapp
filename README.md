# Robin Shrestha's "TinyApp" Project(Lighthouse Labs)

This project was completed as a part of Week 6 requirement while I was a Web Development student in Lighthouse Labs. TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs like bit.ly website do.
This project has an HTTP Server that handles requests from browser(client).
